# CPE-580-GPIO-Project
In this project, I became familiar with the initialization of PortF, reading the state of switches, and manipulating the led's of a Tiva-C tm4c123gh6pm microcontroller. The lab was important because it gave me experience with the process of initializing a GPIO port. I followed the process outlined in Jonathan Valvano's book embedded systems: shape the world, which you can find here: https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/E-Book/. The process for initializing microcontroller ports is listed in Chapter 6 of the book. It also was important because it reinforced concepts from the previous embedded systems course like friendly code and bit-specific addressing. The project is written in embedded C. 
MATERIALS:
Laptop
Keil
Tiva-C tm4c123gh6pm launchpad
PA1 template
Embedded Systems: Shape the World
Lecture 3 (GPIO) 2024
To run the code, you will need to have a laptop, a tiva-c tm4c123gh6pm launchpad, and Keil. There is a walkthrough of the process of installing and configuring Keil here https://users.ece.utexas.edu/%7Evalvano/arm/download2.html.
